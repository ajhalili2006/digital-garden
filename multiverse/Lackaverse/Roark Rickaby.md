## Community annotations

### "Descending into madness"
We might talk about that in the future

### In the animated pilot
* [The fear behind the manic grin](https://www.tumblr.com/lordofdestructionm/714062849327202304/the-fear-behind-the-manic-grin)
	* For some, Rocky's origin story is as depressing as [[Yusei Fudo]] + [[Yusaku Fujiki]] from the Yu-Gi-Oh anime series

## More shitfuckeries in the multiverse
* [[Calvin Allen McMurray]] - That "gunslinging outlaw maniac" cousin
