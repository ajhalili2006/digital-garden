## Summary / Character Intro

**Calvin "Freckle" Allen McMurray**[^1] [^2] is [Nina](https://lackadaisy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Nina "Nina")'s son and [[Roark Rickaby|Rocky]]'s cousin. Freckle first appears in ["Reciprocity"](http://www.lackadaisycats.com/comic.php?comicid=15), though he does not have dialog until the following episode, ["Coconspirator"](http://www.lackadaisycats.com/comic.php?comicid=16).

### "Descending into madness"

In the words of [[Roark Rickaby|Rocky]] himself, he sometimes turn into a "gunslinging outlaw maniac"[^3], especially when he ~~holding~~ using a gun like a madman.

[^4]: From Lackawiki: "Tracy has stated that Freckle's father, Carroll, died in a mundane way, and was indirectly responsible in some manner for Freckle's eccentricities." (link to [archives](https://archivebot.deno.dev/go?url=todo))

While it's not mentioned in the webcomic[^4] yet how and when he become insane (although "unmitigated carnage is a recent development" as seen in ["Quicklime"](https://www.lackadaisycats.com/comic.php?comicid=58)), his personality issues were the reason why he was rejected at the police academy.[^5]
