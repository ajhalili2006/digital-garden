## Summary / Character Intro

**Calvin "Freckle" Allen McMurray**[^1] [^2] is [Nina](https://lackadaisy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Nina "Nina")'s son and [[Roark Rickaby|Rocky]]'s cousin. Freckle first appears in ["Reciprocity"](http://www.lackadaisycats.com/comic.php?comicid=15), though he does not have dialog until the following episode, ["Coconspirator"](http://www.lackadaisycats.com/comic.php?comicid=16). After he is rejected from the police academy due to an "incident", Nina inadvertently causes Freckle to become involved with [Lackadaisy](https://lackadaisy.com/wiki/index.php?title=Lackadaisy "Lackadaisy").
