* It is the intense physical, mental or emotional exhaustion, often accompanied by a loss of skills, that some adults with autism experience. Many autistic people say it results mainly from the cumulative effect of having to navigate a world that is designed for neurotypical people.
* Burnout may especially affect autistic adults who have strong cognitive and language abilities and are working or going to school with neurotypical people.
