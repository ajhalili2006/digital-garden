* **TL;DR**: Treat Jiroh's Kooky Insane Stuff as the unhinged version of his digital garden.
* **From the README**: This repository contains content ranging from his personal character dossiers in different fandoms to some of the unholy grails from the back of his mind, hopefully not suicidal enough to call the ambulance yet.
* **From the [[Murder Drones]] fandom**: A closet containing "NORI'S KOOKY INSANE STUFF" is seen in [The Promening](https://murder-drones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Promening), where Khan stores Uzi's crazed ramblings, hinting at her having a paranoid side to her similar to her daughter as during the events of [Cabin Fever](https://murder-drones.fandom.com/wiki/Cabin_Fever), Khan explained to Uzi that Nori would tell him to prepare for the "upcoming sky demons", "scary singularities" and a "cool 'S' [she] can draw".
