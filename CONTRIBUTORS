# People who either have agreed to the Linux DCO and signed-off their commits
# or have signed one of Recap Time Squad CLAs (excluding any applicable
# assignment agreements specific to this project) and can contribute patches,
# although since this open-source personal project doesn't actively seeks contributions
# this might be rarely updated, just like in AUTHORS.
# 
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file lists people.
# For example, like Google, most of the Recap Time Squad members are listed
# here but not in AUTHORS, because we collectively hold the copyright under
# Recap Time Squad. It's possible that someone from the @recaptime-dev org
# is listed in AUTHORS too as initial maintainer.
