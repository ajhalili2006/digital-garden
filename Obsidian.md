## Open in Obsidian links

1. Clone the repository
```bash
# feel free to change clone paths btw
mkdir -pv ~/git/ajhalili2006/digital-garden-ajhalili2006

# technically canonical URL, although use the gitlab one instead
git clone https://git.vern.cc/ajhalili2006/digital-garden ~/git/ajhalili2006/digital-garden-ajhalili2006

# gitlab
glab repo clone https://mau.dev/andreijiroh.dev/digital-garden ~/git/ajhalili2006/digital-garden-ajhalili2006

# github mirror
gh repo clone ajhalili2006/digital-garden ~/git/ajhalili2006/digital-garden-ajhalili2006
```
2. In an active Obsidian workspace, click **Open another vault** -> **Open folder as vault** -> **Open** and navigate to the directory where the repo is cloned.

3. Enjoy pressing the links! (If you have cloned my garden and it doesn't match the vault name used in app redirects, please rename the vault first.)
