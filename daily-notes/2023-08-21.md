# 2023-08-21

* Previously on [[2023-08-19]], note that time and date are in Philippine Standard Time as I write this, although you do you use UTC for simplicity.
	* Mostly [[Lackadaisy]] webcomic reading madness, now clocking at [#141](https://lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=141)[^1]
* Last hand laundry before the next school year
* OSS work at [[recaptime.dev]]
	* Did some workspace image customization chores: https://github.com/gitpodify/workspace-images/issues/5
* Across the interwebs
	* [The Wayland Book](https://wayland-book.com/)

[^1]: For the technically inclined, we're using the comic panel ID instead of chapter number over at the [mobile-friendly version of the webcomic on Webtoon](http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/lackadaisy/list?title_no=39790)
