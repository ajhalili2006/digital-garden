* Later after midnight, I commit violence against my [[Vaultwarden]] vault and rotated the key, resulting in some items on my personal vault to be missing permanently, so I do some recovery madness before I shoot my foot and nuke the personal vault for good.
	* I also take the liberty of safekeeping the backups on a Gitpod workspace until I could dump them into [[recaptime.dev]]'s Storj DCS bucket.
	* It's still a bit of pain to have data loss happen, maybe because of TBD.
