# 2023-08-17

* Previously on [[2023-08-16]], note that time and date are in Philippine Standard Time as I write this, although you do you use UTC for simplicity.
	* Updating my releases key behind the scenes btw
* I'm getting more comfortable using [[Foam]] alongside [[Obsidian]], especially inside a Gitpod workspace.
* Reading some more Lackadaisy webcomic, clocking at [#77](https://lackadaisy.com/comic.php?comicid=77)
* Across the interwebs
	* From an [[Lackadaisy]] [fanfic on AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/47085124/chapters/119935525): _"Zib didn’t like him, and [[Calvin Allen McMurray|Freckle]] could understand why. He couldn’t even hold it against him, really. He didn’t like himself much, either: a gunslinging outlaw maniac, masquerading as a sweet, innocent, harmless lamb; a cold-blooded killer, disguised as a humble, obedient child of the Lord. He’d committed pretty much every sin in the Bible, and worst of all, he didn’t even have the integrity to own up to it. He hid his true self from his mother, from his girlfriend, from the law—everyone but God and the Devil. Oh, and [[Roark Rickaby|Rocky]], of course."_
