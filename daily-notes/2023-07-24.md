Go back to [[daily notes]], also synced at this week's recap in the [[Personal Board.canvas|Personal Board (open that in Obsidian)]].

* ~~Currently working a bit offline due to some technical difficulties on ISP side, but now fixed. Possibly due to this month's bill past due (as usual).~~
* New contributions this day:
	* https://github.com/flancian/agora/pull/29
* ~~Actually do manual laundry later this day after taking a deep breath and do house chores (because [[executive functioning issues]] is considered as [[laziness]] among most [[neurotypicals]])~~ Also done btw.
* Watched Week 72 [[Hermitcraft Recap|recap]] in the Hermitcraft server: https://youtu.be/_s2MXeg5edQ?si=pQnVssfpNdakiWRG
