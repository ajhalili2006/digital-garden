* Previously on [[2023-08-06]], note that time and date are in Philippine Standard Time as I write this, although you do you use UTC for simplicity.
	* Attempted to push my digital garden repo to sourcehut, but I forgot about it doesn't support LFS yet.
* All things [[Lackadaisy]]
	* The more I dig further about [[Roark Rickaby|Rocky]] and [[Calvin Allen McMurray|Freckle]], the more my autistic head want to do a lot of `git diff` in the multiverse
	* On Freckle's personality and traits in the community wiki at Fandom-dot-com, obviously this is America after all:
		> "*However, he seems to have a sadistic side that he cannot control. If Freckle is given a weapon, he becomes wild and manically laughs like his cousin Rocky. He seems to be very skilled with guns, most likely due to him wanting to become a police officer, though this behavior caused him to be rejected from the police academy.*" ([from the wiki](https://lackadaisy.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin_%22Freckle%22_Allen_McMurray#Personality_and_traits))
* OSS work at [[recaptime.dev]] or whatever
	* None for now.
* Personal side projects
	* N/A for now.
* Anything else, especially IRL
	* Officially enrolled for Senior High School at Computer Systems Servicing, probably a bit (or too) far from web/software dev, but I like to consider stacking NCs alongside any future certs and experience in open-source like Jengga.
