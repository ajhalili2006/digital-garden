* Earlier from [[2023-08-03]]
	* Did the bloody hand laundry finally after weeks of non-stop rainfall chaos in PH.
* OSS work at [[recaptime.dev]]
	* Did some obvious Docker and CI related business for [`gh:gitpodify/workspace-images`](https://github.com/gitpodify/workspace-images), especially around pre-commit configs
	* `git init` + `bashbox init` for [`gh:gitpodify/dazzle-build-script`](https://github.com/gitpodify/dazzle-build-script) based on the build scripts on `gh:gitpod-io/workspace-images`
* Personal side projects
	* Not sure if I could kick on Doctorate lessons and activities for Weeks 2-4
* Across the interwebs
	* **[So, about that "Gaming Channel"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UigR53aE6Sg) from [[TechLinked]]'s [[TalkLinked]] podcast**: Behind-the-scenes talk about LMG's new gaming channel, [[GameLinked]].
	* **(CW: [[Internet shitfuckery]] ahead)** From [@pot8um@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/pot8um): Look what I found—not [one](https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/what-john-rich-do-twitter-disabled-person-controversy-explained-country-singer-garners-backlash-online), but [*two*](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/john-rich-sparks-backlash-after-disabled-person-calls-him-out-2230953/) articles about the time a country music star [fucked around and found out](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fuck-around-and-find-out-fafo).
		* Like holy $#!t, why the actual shitfuckery I got this. Maybe I should check my inbox again if it's from Substack or maybe from fedi.
		* For context, this involves a bit of ableism or face apperance sort of shitshow. For the love of god, I'll not link the tweet that caused that digital wildfires to be released (go read the news articles above). That madman also pulled the infantilization card to a disabled woman on birdsite hellsite, humorously referred to her as a “poor girl”.
		* As an fellow autist, this is depressing to read, especially since the disability community attacked and traumatized since the Covid pandemic began ([@kellyIsSomeOne@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/kellyIsSomeOne))
	* Seriously did some obvious [[Lackadaisy]] lorebook reading, both in the currently-archived official wiki and the community-maintained one on Fandom.
		* From the trivia section about Rocky and Freckle's laugh: "Where Rocky's crazy-laugh is all manic glee, Freckle's is more like cathartic rage - it would come across a little meaner". [(see original)](https://lackadaisy.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin_%22Freckle%22_Allen_McMurray#cite_note-F20091006-7)"
		* As mentioned in the archived wiki, Tracy has stated that Rocky did not complete his primary education. (which is obviously raise my eyebrows)
