* Late Night Work
	* Successfully migrated database data for [[recaptime.dev]]'s [[Vaultwarden]] and [[Wiki.js]] instance to [[Supabase]], in case of issues on my personal railway.app account.
	* Did some manual data restoration on my personal vault after the chaos last night (also exported the pre-key rotation data while in offline mode, which is enough)
* Discoveries and Stuff
	* Tried [an commit editor](https://github.com/sonnyp/Commit) for Git instead of using VS Code, although I may change my mind.
	* To keep things fine, maybe I'll plan to branch things out on my dotfiles repo soonish.
