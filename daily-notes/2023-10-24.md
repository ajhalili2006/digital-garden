* Please blame my autistic self for watching [TADC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwAPLk_sQ3w) instead of doing lectures. The effects of burnout has creeping lately since few weeks ago.
	* God I also finished my lectures in Oral Communication finally.
* Any guesses why I'm looping [Loverus](https://youtu.be/yOZX8FkMuQw) by Tony Romera other than?
* Back at home, I did some painful manual maintenance work involving fixing Chrome profiles after a upgrade gone horribly wrong. ANRs follow afterward, and an prompt about unresponsive Chrome were shown so I did the restart and everything's [[cool and normal]].
* From my mixtapes: "It feels so good to be letting go. It's so much better now Iâ€™m not alone" (from [Royal Blood's Mad Visions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRTAmgcopL0)
	* After some listens, the song gave me [[Calvin Allen McMurray|Freckle]] feels.
