* re-watching [[Fundy's Mind]] as part of writing a bloody essay explaining how my autistic brain interpreted it (see [[Fundy's Mind as interpreted by an autistic]] once I published da draft)
* all things [[Obsidian]]
	* installed [`obsidian-icon-folder`](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-icon-folder) ([repo](https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-icon-folder)) plugin on [[Obsidian]] to feel at home like in [[Notion]] and [[Coda]].
	* fix some [[golink]] syntax issues on some files, because I remembered about [[wikilinks anywhere]]
