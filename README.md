# ~ajhalili2006's digital garden in Obsidian

Welcome to my [[digital garden]], which is part of the [Agora](https://anagora.org/agora) and can be found rendered in [https://anagora.org/](https://anagora.org/). You can also view this in [[Obsidian]] by cloning the repo and opening it as a vault. (Viewing this in GitLab and other git mirrors I (and maybe other people) maintain might cause you [[backend pain]] due to wikilinks may not work, among [other Obsidian-specific Markdown formatting]().)

## How to navigate
* The most obvious way to navigate around here is using Agora's search feature.
* You can also find your way via tags:
	* [[daily notes]] - sometimes an daily diary, often my log of what I have done in the day
	* [[Gildedguy Stories]] - my starter pack for the Gildedguy Stories series
	* [[ajhalili2006]] - mini personal README about me and the context behind the username
