# YYY-MM-DD

* Previously on [[YYYY-MM-DD]], note that time and date are in Philippine Standard Time as I write this, although you do you use UTC for simplicity.
	* Anything that done during the night (between 22:00 and 05:00 the next day)
* List anything you have done in that day, as much as possible.
* Across the interwebs
	* List finds across the internet, any shitfuckeries, etc.
